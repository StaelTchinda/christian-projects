## Contribution Guidelines

 - Items should be sorted alphabetically within categories.
 - Each item should have a link.
 - The link should be on the name of the project.
 - If a project has separate links for different platforms, include links on the platform name. For example, `[Android](link)`.
 - Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
 - Projects that contain data only (e.g., json, yaml, xml, txt) should have a `platform` type of "data".
 - Projects that contain scripts only should have a `platform` type of "script".
 - API/service projects should have a `platform` type of "API".

## Project Requirements

**Christian Projects** is for projects that are useful to developers. 

 - All projects should be directly related to the Christian faith. This could be expanded to include, for example, the writings of Josephus, but would not include a todo app.
 - Code projects should be open source, but there are no license restrictions.
 - API and related projects should be non-commercial or at least have non-commercial components. For example, an API that provides a free tier of up to 100 requests per day would be allowed.
